/**
 * This DFA-like class is used for splitting a string into tokens.
 *
 * Actually, that's not a true DFA. A **stack** of states is stored in the process of automation execution. Given the
 * next character, the automation gives it to the state from the top of the stack, which decides what to do with the
 * character. There are four legal actions to manipulate the stack. You may
 * 1) Push a new state on the stack.
 * 2) Push a new state and delegate the given character analysis to it (so its implementation will be called
 *    immediately.
 * 3) Pop the current state from the stack.
 * 4) Pop the current state from the stack and exit.
 *
 * This allows to simply analyze a formal language with many kind of quotes with different meanings. For example, it is
 * easy enough to handle characters escaped with backslash. Also, this allows to join strings in bash-style with
 * virtually no developing expenses.
 *
 * The goal of this class is to efficiently tokenize a string into sequence of {NCli::TToken}, so there are additional
 * methods in {@link NCli::TTokenizeDFA::TExecCallback} which are designed to manipulate the current token sequence.
 *
 * You may see an example of its usage in {@link NCli::TTokenizer}.

     * stack and all rules stored in.
